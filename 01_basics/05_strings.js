//* Concatenation in JavaScript
//? In JavaScript, the + sign is not only used for arithmetic addition but also for string concatenation. When the + operator is used with strings, it concatenates the strings together.
//? It's important to note that if any operand of the + operator is a string, JavaScript will treat the other operands as strings as well, resulting in string concatenation. If both operands are numbers, the + operator performs numeric addition.

// const str = "Hello " + "World";
// console.log(str);
