/*
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
This means that variable types are determined at runtime, and you do not need to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it.
You can assign different types of values to a variable during its lifetime.

For example, in JavaScript, you can do the following:

let x = 10; // x is now a number
x = "Hello"; // x is now a string
x = true; // x is now a boolean
On the other hand, statically typed languages require you to declare the variable's type explicitly, and the type checking is done at compile-time, before the code is executed.

Languages like Java, C++, and TypeScript are statically typed, and they require you to specify the variable type explicitly when declaring them:

// ---------- Some Questions ---------------

// console.log(typeof ("5" - 3));                         //output: number

// console.log(2 < 12 < 5);                    //output: True        (consider first =>  2<12 => true, its value is considered as 1. Then, 1<5 which is true thatâ€™s why output is true).

// console.log("20" + 10 + 10);              //output: 201010      (string + number gives string).
